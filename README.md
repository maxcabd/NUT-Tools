# NUT Tools

NUT Tools is a very basic executable for exporting NUT/DDS textures from CyberConnect2 .xfbin files and creating valid .nut files from .dds files.

## Installation

Download the .zip file from Releases.


## Usage

* Drag and drop .xfbin (must contain NUT textures) file onto the .exe to get NUT/DDS textures.
* Drag and drop 1 .dds file to create a .nut file with 1 GIDX texture.
* Drag and drop 2 .dds files to create a .nut file with 2 GIDX textures. And so on and so forth.
* Once you have your .nut file use SutandoTsukai181's .xfbin Blender addon  [here](https://github.com/SutandoTsukai181/cc2_xfbin_blender "here title") to load your .nut file for your model, stage, effect file, etc.


## More Information
* Currently does not support the batch creation of .nut files. Drag DDS file(s) one at a time.
* Only supports DXT1, DXT3, DXT4, B5G5R5A1, B4G4R4A4, B5G6R5, and B8G8R8A formats.
